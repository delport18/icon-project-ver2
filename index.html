    <h1> Why the unhoused avoid shelters </h1>
    <h2> <em> With homelessness on the rise, why are some of those affected not accepting help that is offered? </em> </h2>

    <p> According to the New York State Comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, the state is currently experiencing <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/01/dinapoli-numbers-homeless-population-doubled-new-york#:~:text=Homelessness%20decreased%20in%20New%20York,a%20higher%20increase%20at%20180%25." target="blank"> a boom in its unhoused population. </a> This trend has been increasing since the COVID eviction moratoriums ended in 2022. </p>
    <p> With a surge of unhoused individuals living on the streets, it is imperative that we analyze the societal safety nets that are provided to these people in need and determine if any changes need to be made. One of the cornerstone safety nets in regards to housing is shelters. However, <a href="https://citylimits.org/homeless-advocates-sue-over-new-city-rules-for-accessing-low-barrier-shelter-beds/" target="blank"> new DHS regulations have been criticized </a> for increasing the difficulty for the unhoused to be placed into shelters or safe havens. </p>
    <p> I reached out to the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness (<a href="https://www.icph.org/" target="blank">ICPH</a>) and Joseph Campo, director of the <a href="https://www.stfrancishousebrooklyn.com/" target="blank"> St. Francis House</a>, a non-profit haven for young men in need, to discuss homelessness and the roles of shelters. During these discussions, many different reasons for why homeless people prefer to stay away from shelters were mentioned: </p>

    <p> <strong> Violence: </strong> Many people, especially single adults who are placed in shelters, refrain from returning to them due to the violence that they experience. “One of the biggest things [the unhoused] say is ‘I am not going to the shelter, I was beaten up there’ or ‘my stuff gets stolen,’” said Linda Bazerjian, current employee of the ICPH and former DHS worker. “I think that is a big struggle when you’re dealing with congregate [shelters].” </p>

    <p> <strong> Time: </strong> Joseph Campo says that one of the biggest worries unhoused people face, even when they have shelter, is worrying about  “Where am I going tomorrow?” He is referring to the lack of guarantee that shelters will provide a consistent place to sleep. He fixed this problem for his organization by making the St. Francis House a safe haven with no time constraints or limits. According to Campo, as long as the men were on their feet and working, they could stay as long as they wanted. “I had this one guy live [in the St. Francis house] for 15 years. He left when he got married. It’s not a shelter.” </p>

    <p> <strong> Lack of Privacy:</strong> Shelters, especially those for single adults, tend to lack privacy in a few regards. When it comes to bedding arrangements, Campo believes one of the most important differentiators that St. Francis offers in comparison to shelters is having one’s own space. Campo took over the St. Francis house in 1992 and said that one of the first things he did was “cleaned out the whole house, took all the bunk beds, and threw them out. Everybody gets their own bed. At their age, everyone should have their own privacy in their own room.” </p>

    <p> <strong> Lack of Compassion: </strong> Campo thinks a big factor that is lacking in shelters is trust. “[shelters] don’t care. They feed them cheese. I feed them steak,” referring to how he believes shelter systems literally and metaphorically don’t treat their unhoused with respect or with proper resources. </p>
